# Task 3 - Image Captioning AI

This project generates text captions for images using a combination of CNN for feature extraction and RNN/transformer for caption generation.

## Features
- Uses pre-trained InceptionV3 model
- Extracts features and generates captions
- Example image included

## Requirements
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Open `image_captioning.ipynb`
2. Upload an image
3. Run the cells to extract features and generate caption

## Sample Output
Input Image: [shown]  
Generated Caption: "a group of people standing on a beach"
